# Lab 6 - *PhotoMap*

**PhotoMap** is an app that allows the user to search for locations using the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs) and create a pin with an image annotation.

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] User can view a map (+2pt)
- [x] User can take a photo (+1pt)
- [x] User can tag a location (+1pt)
- [x] User can drop a pin with image annotation (+1pt)

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] User sees a custom annotation (+1pt)
- [ ] User can see Fullscreen Picture (+1pt)
- [ ] User sees a custom image for the "pin" (+1pt)
- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. add a location anywhere in the world
2. session persists after closing the app

## Notes

It took me some time to figure out how to pass information between controllers when using segues. Other than that, this lab wasn't too bad (for the required stories at least).
